## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

### **Companies by Founding Era**
Most leading SaaS companies were founded between **2000–2010**, with another strong wave after 2010. This aligns with the rise of cloud computing and subscription-based software models.

### **Ratings Distribution**
Customer and product ratings cluster between **4.0 and 4.5**, indicating strong satisfaction across top SaaS firms and a competitive focus on product quality.

### **Top 12 Companies by ARR**
A small group of companies dominate total ARR, highlighting a top-heavy market structure where a few leaders generate the majority of revenue.

### **ARR vs Funding**
Funding does not always correlate with higher ARR. Some companies achieve strong revenue with moderate funding, while others rely heavily on capital to scale.

### **Employees vs ARR**
There is no direct relationship between company size and revenue. Several firms generate high ARR with relatively lean teams, demonstrating scalable and efficient business models.

### **Industries by Average ARR**
Enterprise-focused sectors such as **Cloud, Security, CRM, and Data-driven SaaS** consistently show higher average ARR than niche or consumer-focused SaaS categories.
